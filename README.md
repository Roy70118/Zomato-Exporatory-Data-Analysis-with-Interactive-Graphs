# Zomato-Exporatory-Data-Analysis-with-Interactive-Graphs
This is Zomato Exporatory Data Analysis Project which aims to analyze the Zomato restaurant dataset.
 which contains information about various restaurants in multiple cities around the world
 This project includes interactive graphs that provide insights into the dataset.
 The EDA process starts by importing the dataset and cleaning it by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types to their appropriate formats. Once the data is cleaned, the exploratory data analysis process begins.

The GitHub repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that showcases the EDA process with the help of interactive graphs. The notebook uses various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib and seaborn  to visualize the data.

The interactive graphs in the notebook allow users to explore the data visually and gain insights into various aspects of the dataset. For example, there are graphs that show the distribution of restaurants across different cities and countries, the types of cuisines offered by restaurants, the ratings and reviews of restaurants, and the average cost of dining in different cities.

Users can interact with the graphs by hovering over data points to see more information, zooming in and out of the graphs, and selecting specific data points to view more details. The interactive graphs provide a user-friendly way to explore the dataset and understand the trends and patterns in the data.
